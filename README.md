A simple template for Dropplets, the minimalist markdown blogging platform

##What is Dropplets?

[Dropplets](https://github.com/circa75/dropplets) is a minimalist Markdown blogging platform focused on delivering just what you need in a blogging solution, but absolutely nothing you don't. When it comes to basic blogging, all you really want to do is write & publish which is where Dropplets excels. It's databaseless, so it installs on any server in just about 30 seconds. 

##How to install Citizen?

Just copy the `citizen-dropplets` folder into the `templates` folder of your Dropplets installation. You can now select Citizen at the Installed Templates section of your Dropplets admin bar.

You can change `profile.jpg` beforehand to your image of choice.

##Demo

You can see Citizen in action at [paszternak.me](http://paszternak.me).

##ToDos

- ~~style.css needs post headers' styles (h2-h6)~~
- style.css needs some media queries to improve responsible view.
- Blog Twitter profile image integration into the header instead of `profile.jpg`.
